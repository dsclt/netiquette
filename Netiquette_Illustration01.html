		<div>Is your technology working?

Test your audio levels and volume before entering class. Try not to use your device microphone, but rather wear a headset with a microphone. This cuts down on background noise and improves your audio quality when speaking.

 When you are not speaking, mute your microphone to limit any noise and distractions for your class.</div>

		<div>Is your technology working?

When your camera is on, it is important to consider how you are framed. Try keeping your head and shoulders in frame and avoid cutting off the top of your head. Keeping your camera level with your eyes will help you maintain eye contact and engagement with your class.</div>

		<div>What’s your environment like?
Ensure the room you are attending class in is free of distractions and noises. These can divert your attention and disrupt class for your teacher and classmates. Some common distractions include pets, TV’s, stereos, housemates and outside noises.

		<div>What’s your environment like?
Before entering your online class, preview your video. What does your background look like? Is there clutter or mess? Is the lighting too harsh or too dark? An ideal background is a plain-coloured wall but - as this isn’t always possible - just make sure your background is neat, clean and professional. 
</div>
		<div>How do you look?

 When attending class from home, it can be easy to forget that you are not alone and are still in a school environment. When attending an online class, consider your:

Presentation: Present yourself for online class as you would for face-to-face classes.

 Body language: Ensure you are sitting up straight, alert and are looking at the camera, especially when speaking or during a discussion

Attentiveness: Pay attention to your class. This includes resisting the urge to multitask, staying off your phone as much as possible, and getting involved in class through verbal discussions, online chat, or other program features.</div>
